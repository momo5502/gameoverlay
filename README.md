</h1>

A high-performance Windows process emulator that operates at syscall level, providing full control over process execution through comprehensive hooking capabilities.

Perfect for security research, malware analysis, and DRM research where fine-grained control over process execution is required.

Built in C++ and powered by the Unicorn Engine.

## Key Features

* 🔄 __Syscall-Level Emulation__
	* Instead of reimplementing Windows APIs, the emulator operates at the syscall level, allowing it to leverage existing system DLLs
* 📝 __Advanced Memory Management__
	* Supports Windows-specific memory types including reserved, committed, built on top of Unicorn's memory management
* 📦 __Complete PE Loading__
	* Handles executable and DLL loading with proper memory mapping, relocations, and TLS
* ⚡ __Exception Handling__
	* Implements Windows structured exception handling (SEH) with proper exception dispatcher and unwinding support
* 🧵 __Threading Support__
	* Provides a scheduled (round-robin) threading model
* 💾 __State Management__
	* Supports both full state serialization and ~~fast in-memory snapshots~~ (currently broken 😕)
* 💻 __Debugging Interface__
	* Implements GDB serial protocol for integration with common debugging tools (IDA Pro, GDB, LLDB, VS Code, ...)

> [!NOTE]  
> The project is still in a very early, prototypy state. The code still needs a lot of cleanup and many features and syscalls need to be implemented. However, constant progress is being made :)

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
* Windows 64-bit (click [here](https://github.com/momo5502/emulator/milestone/1) for cross-platform status)
* CMake
* Git

### Getting Started

Clone the repository with submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/momo5502/emulator.git
cd emulator
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Run the following commands in an x64 Development Command Prompt

### Visual Studio 2022

```bash
cmake --preset=vs2022
```
Solution will be generated at `build/vs2022/emulator.sln`

### Ninja

Debug build:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset=debug
```

Release build:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset=release
```

## Dumping the Registry

The emulator needs a registry dump to run, otherwise it will print `Bad hive file` errors.  
You can create one by running the <a href="./src/tools/grab-registry.bat">src/tools/grab-registry.bat</a> script as administrator.  
This will create a `registry` folder that needs to be placed in the working directory of the emulator.

## Running Tests

The project uses CTest for testing. Choose your preferred method:

**Visual Studio:**
- Build the `RUN_TESTS` target

**Ninja:**
```bash
cd build/release  # or build/debug
ctest
```
